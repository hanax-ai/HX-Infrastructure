# Task 3.01 - "Pre-Flight Checks and Environment Validation"

### Task Overview

- **Task ID**: 3.01
- **Task Name**: Pre-Flight Checks and Environment Validation
- **Description**: Ensure the target host meets all prerequisites before any changes. Validate DNS, network, domain, CA trust, and Python runtime. Save evidence for audit.
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Duration**: 30-45 minutes

### Dependencies & Prerequisites

- **Predecessor Tasks**: None
- **Dependencies**:
  - System dependencies: Target host access, DNS, domain, CA
  - Data dependencies: None
  - Personnel dependencies: Ops engineer with sudo

### Execution Environment

- **Target Server/Environment**: hx-api-server.dev-test.hana-x.ai
- **Required Permissions**: Sudo/root on target
- **Resource Requirements**: N/A

### Task Activities & Subtasks
1. Check DNS resolution for all involved hosts
2. Validate netplan config, resolver, and network posture
3. Confirm domain join and sudo privileges for agent0
4. Ensure HX Root CA is present and trusted
5. Check/install Python 3.11 and pip
6. Save evidence under `.evidence/api-preflight/<ts>/`

### Implementation Requirements (SOLID Principles)
- Single Responsibility: Each check is a separate Ansible task
- Open/Closed: Checks can be extended for new requirements
- Liskov Substitution: Can be reused for other hosts
- Interface Segregation: Each check is modular
- Dependency Inversion: Use Ansible modules, not shell scripts

### Configuration Files
- Config File Location: N/A
- Environment Variables: N/A
- Parameter Settings: N/A

### Success Criteria
- Primary Success Metrics: All checks pass, evidence bundle saved
- Acceptance Criteria: No failed checks, evidence is complete
- Performance Benchmarks: N/A
- Quality Gates: All pre-flight checks must pass before proceeding

### Testing & Validation
- Unit Tests: Ansible syntax check
- Integration Tests: Playbook dry-run
- System Tests: All checks run and pass
- User Acceptance Tests: N/A
- Test Data Requirements: N/A

### Results Capture
- Output Location: `~/hx-ansible/.evidence/api-preflight/<ts>/`
- Log Files: Ansible playbook logs
- Metrics Collection: N/A
- Documentation: Update evidence location in project docs
- Artifacts: Evidence bundle, logs

### Rollback Plan
- Rollback Triggers: Failed checks
- Rollback Procedures: Remediate and re-run checks
- Recovery Time Objective: N/A

### Sign-off
- Completion Date: [To be filled]
- Status: Not Started
