# Ansible Vault Security Audit Report

**Date**: September 15, 2025  
**Auditor**: Security Review  
**Status**: ACTIONS COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

A security review identified that `ansible.cfg` contained a `vault_password_file` reference pointing to `.vault_pass.txt`, which could pose a security risk if not properly managed. This audit documents the current security posture and remediation actions taken.

## Current Security Status

### ✅ Positive Findings

1. **File Permissions**: `.vault_pass.txt` has restrictive permissions (600 - owner read/write only)
2. **Git Security**: `.vault_pass.txt` is properly listed in `.gitignore`
3. **No Git History**: The vault password file has never been committed to the repository
4. **Clean Working Tree**: No vault password files found in git history

### ⚠️ Areas Requiring Action

1. **File-based Password Storage**: Production environments should not use file-based vault passwords
2. **Configuration Update**: `ansible.cfg` needs to be updated for production use

## Actions Taken

### 1. Documentation Created

- **Vault Security Guide**: `/home/agent0/hx-ansible/docs/vault_security.md`
  - Best practices for vault password management
  - Migration instructions for different environments
  - Emergency response procedures

### 2. Secure Configuration Template

- **Secure ansible.cfg**: `/home/agent0/hx-ansible/ansible.cfg.secure`
  - Template without `vault_password_file` directive
  - Ready for production use

### 3. Migration Tooling

- **Migration Script**: `/home/agent0/hx-ansible/scripts/secure_vault_migration.sh`
  - Interactive script to help migrate to secure password methods
  - Supports environment variables, prompts, and external secrets
  - Includes security checks and recommendations

### 4. Code Updates

- Updated LiteLLM vault setup documentation to recommend secure practices
- Removed references to file-based password storage in automation guides

## Recommendations for Production

### Immediate Actions

1. **For CI/CD Pipelines**:
   ```bash
   export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD="${CI_ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD}"
   echo "$ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD" | ansible-playbook site.yml
   ```

2. **For Interactive Use**:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass
   ```

3. **For Production Systems**:
   - Integrate with enterprise secret management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
   - Use service accounts with minimal permissions
   - Implement audit logging for vault access

### Password Rotation

After implementing secure password management:

```bash
# Rotate all vault passwords
find . -name "*.yml" -exec grep -l "ANSIBLE_VAULT" {} \; | \
  xargs -I {} ansible-vault rekey {}
```

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] Vault password file has restrictive permissions
- [x] Vault password file is in .gitignore
- [x] No vault passwords in git history
- [x] Documentation created for secure practices
- [x] Migration tools provided
- [ ] Production ansible.cfg updated (manual action required)
- [ ] Vault passwords rotated (manual action required)
- [ ] External secret management implemented (environment-specific)

## Risk Assessment

**Current Risk Level**: LOW (for development)  
**Production Risk Level**: MEDIUM (if file-based passwords are used)

**Mitigation**: Follow the migration guide to implement environment-appropriate secret management before production deployment.

## Next Steps

1. Run `/home/agent0/hx-ansible/scripts/secure_vault_migration.sh` to migrate
2. Update deployment documentation with chosen method
3. Rotate all vault passwords
4. Implement monitoring for vault access
5. Schedule regular password rotation (quarterly recommended)
